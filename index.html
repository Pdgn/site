          <h4>What is PdgnCo?</h4>
          <p>PdgnCo (or pdgn for short) is a small IRC network founded on October 27th, 2014 by 
             <a href="http://aaronweiss.us">Aaron Weiss</a> as a bastion of democratic autonomism on 
             the Internet. We also operate a community blog that can be found 
             <a href="http://blog.pdgn.co">here</a>. You'll find both insightful writings from 
             community members, as well as network status updates there. Pdgn aims to consistently 
             embody the spirit and values of its community. We have a 
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary">warrant canary</a> posted
             <a href="./canary.txt">here</a>. Our mascot's name is Pidgey. She was lovingly designed
             by the talented <a href="http://apdenoatis.deviantart.com/">Shannon Sheu</a>, and
             vectorized by Grant Wu.</p>
          <h4>What are these values?</h4>
          <ol>           
            <li>Education &dash; This network is a place of learning, and aims to encourage it when possible.</li> 
            <li>Democracy &dash; All major network decisions are decided publicly in <code>#pdgn</code>.</li>
            <li>Autonomy &dash; Server operators will only intervene for the health of the network.</li>           
            <li>Free Speech &dash; Censorship of any kind is not condoned on this network.</li>
            <li>Privacy &dash; There is absolutely no server-side logging on the network.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>How do I access Pdgn?</h4>
          <p>You can access the network via your favorite IRC client. For graphical clients, we 
             recommend the aptly-named <a href="http://pidgin.im">Pidgin</a> on Windows and Linux, and 
             <a href="http://www.codeux.com/textual/">Textual</a> on OS X. In the way of terminal 
             clients, many of our members swear by <a href="https://weechat.org">weechat</a>. Once 
             you've found a client, you can connect to the  network via 
             <a href="ircs://irc.pdgn.co:6697">irc.pdgn.co</a>. It's important to note that the 
             network is only accessible over SSL, and uses the standard SSL port 6697. You may wish
             to access a regional server instead. Below you'll find a table of in-network servers,
             and their approximate locations.</p>
          <table class="table table-striped">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Server Name</th>
                <th>Server Address</th>
                <th>Server Location</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Columba</td>
                <td>columba.pdgn.co</td>
                <td>New York, NY</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Raphus</td>
                <td>raphus.pdgn.co</td>
                <td>San Francisco, CA</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Turtur</td>
                <td>turtur.pdgn.co</td>
                <td>Frankfurt, Germany</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>Perhaps uniquely, Pdgn is also accessible in its entirety over 
             <a href="http://hyperboria.net">Hyperboria</a>, a secure and decentralized network 
             using <a href="http://cjdns.info">cjdns</a>. As a general rule of thumb, everything can 
             be accessed through Hyperboria by prepending <code>h.</code> to its address. So,
             general network access is available via 
             <a href="ircs://h.irc.pdgn.co:6697">h.irc.pdgn.co</a>. Although cjdns has network-level
             encryption in place, for logistical reasons, you must still connect with SSL. Below
             you'll find a reproduction of the earlier table but with each server's Hyperboria address.</p>
          <table class="table table-striped">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Server Name</th>
                <th>Hyperboria Address</th>
                <th>Server Location</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Columba</td>
                <td>h.columba.pdgn.co</td>
                <td>New York, NY</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Raphus</td>
                <td>h.raphus.pdgn.co</td>
                <td>San Francisco, CA</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Turtur</td>
                <td>h.turtur.pdgn.co</td>
                <td>Frankfurt, Germany</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <h4>How is Pdgn operated?</h4>
          <p>Pdgn is currently operated solely by its founder, 
             <a href="http://aaronweiss.us/">Aaron Weiss</a>. This means that there's absolutely no
             administrative bureaucracy of any sort, and there's only one person that you have to
             trust to keep the network values uncompromised. You can find him on the network as 
             <code>awe</code>, where he's just about always hanging around in <code>#pdgn</code>.</p>
          <p>Pdgn is currently funded out of pocket by its founder, but also accepts donations. 
             Donations can be made via Bitcoin to the official PdgnCo wallet,
             <code>1BZmyVhDu3p6xqsnat81fYD7hm3ZqR2bf</code>. All donations will go immediately 
             towards paying for existing and additional network hardware. Maintenance of the 
             network is a volunteer service, and as such, none of the donations will be taken for 
             personal use.</p>
