        <h1 class="lead">What is PdgnCo?</h1>
        <p>
          PdgnCo (or pdgn for short) was a small IRC network founded on October 27th, 2014 by
          <a href="https://aaronweiss.us/">Aaron Weiss</a> as an autonomous internet community to
          discuss tech, software, politics, media, and more. Its goal was to exist as a friendly,
          inclusive space for community discussion on an internet increasingly dominated by just a
          few multinational corporations. Pdgn was officially shut down on July 4th, 2020.

        <h1>How did Pdgn operate?</h1>
        <p>
          Pdgn was maintained solely by its founder, <a href="https://aaronweiss.us/">Aaron
          Weiss</a>&mdash;known around these parts as <code>awe</code>. The day-to-day decisions
          about maintenance were largely decided by him, but were all reported publicly in
          <code>#pdgn</code>. Community opinions were incorporated into every major decision about
          the network. The network was hosted on <a href="https://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>
          and funded out-of-pocket by <code>awe</code>. Pdgn has an official mascot named Pidgey.
          She was lovingly designed by <a href="http://apdenoatis.deviantart.com/">Shannon Sheu</a>,
          and later carefully vectorized by Grant Wu.
