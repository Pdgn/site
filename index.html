        <h1>What is PdgnCo?</h1>
        <p>
          PdgnCo (or pdgn for short) is a small IRC network founded on October 27th, 2014 by
          <a href="https://aaronweiss.us/">Aaron Weiss</a> as an autonomous internet community to
          discuss tech, software, politics, media, and more. Its goal is to exist as a friendly,
          inclusive space for community discussion on an internet increasingly dominated by just a
          few multinational corporations. Pdgn reflects and embodies the spirit and values of its
          community. For transparency, we have a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary">warrant canary</a> posted
          <a href="./canary.txt">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h1>What are these values?</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Transparency &ndash; All major network decisions are decided publicly in
            <code>#pdgn</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Autonomy &ndash; Administrators will only intervene for the health of the network.
          </li>
          <li>Privacy &ndash; There is no server-side chat logging or inspection whatsoever.</li>
          <li>Education &ndash; pdgn is a place of learning, and aims to encourage it always.</li>
          <li>Community &ndash; pdgn aims to foster friendship and compelling conversation.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>How do I access Pdgn?</h1>
        <p>
          You can access the network via your favorite IRC client. For graphical clients, we
          recommend the aptly-named <a href="https://pidgin.im">Pidgin</a> on Windows and Linux, and
          <a href="https://www.codeux.com/textual/">Textual</a> on macOS. In the way of terminal
          clients, many of our members swear by <a href="https://weechat.org">weechat</a>. Once
          you've found a client, you can connect to the  network via
          <a href="ircs://irc.pdgn.co:6697">irc.pdgn.co</a>. It's important to note that the
          network is only accessible over SSL, and uses the standard SSL port <code>6697</code>. For
          better latency, you may wish to access a regional server instead. Below you'll find a
          table of our servers, and their locations.
        </p>
        <table class="table table-striped">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Server Name</th>
              <th>Server Address</th>
              <th>Server Location</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Columba</td>
              <td>columba.pdgn.co</td>
              <td>New York, NY</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Raphus</td>
              <td>raphus.pdgn.co</td>
              <td>San Francisco, CA</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Turtur</td>
              <td>turtur.pdgn.co</td>
              <td>Frankfurt, Germany</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
          Perhaps uniquely, Pdgn is also accessible in its entirety over
          <a href="http://hyperboria.net">Hyperboria</a>, a secure and decentralized network
          using <a href="http://cjdns.info">cjdns</a>. As a general rule of thumb, everything can
          be accessed through Hyperboria by prepending <code>h.</code> to its address. So,
          general network access is available via
          <a href="ircs://h.irc.pdgn.co:6697">h.irc.pdgn.co</a>. Although cjdns has network-level
          encryption in place, for logistical reasons, you must still connect with SSL. Below
          you'll find a reproduction of the earlier table but with each server's Hyperboria address.
        </p>
        <table class="table table-striped">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Server Name</th>
              <th>Hyperboria Address</th>
              <th>Server Location</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Columba</td>
              <td>h.columba.pdgn.co</td>
              <td>New York, NY</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Raphus</td>
              <td>h.raphus.pdgn.co</td>
              <td>San Francisco, CA</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Turtur</td>
              <td>h.turtur.pdgn.co</td>
              <td>Frankfurt, Germany</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <h1>How does Pdgn operate?</h1>
        <p>
          Pdgn is maintained solely by its founder, <a href="https://aaronweiss.us/">Aaron
          Weiss</a>&mdash;known around these parts as <code>awe</code>. The day-to-day decisions
          about maintenance are largely decided by him, but are all reported publicly in
          <code>#pdgn</code>. Community opinions are incorporated into every major decision about
          the network. The network is hosted on <a href="https://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>
          and funded out-of-pocket by <code>awe</code>. Pdgn has an official mascot named Pidgey.
          She was lovingly designed by <a href="http://apdenoatis.deviantart.com/">Shannon Sheu</a>,
          and later carefully vectorized by Grant Wu.
